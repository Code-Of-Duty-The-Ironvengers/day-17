It must be hard to be as wrong as you... I am happy I am not as wrong as you.
Sucks to be you. AAH

<div>But maybe you are just not a part of the cool group... Yet. Do you wish not
  to be as wrong ? Fill the form below
</div>

<form action="/create-student" method="post">
  <input
    name="studentName"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Write up your name, fool"
  />
  <input
    name="country"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Where do you come from, Fool?"
  />

  <input
    type="password"
    name="password"
    placeholder="Please, dont write password"
  />
